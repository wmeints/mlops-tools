# Building blocks

This section maps concepts to building blocks. For each building block we provide a description of the functionalities provided by the component
and information on where to learn more about the component.

The building blocks in this section are based on the scope diagram that we've shown in the README of the repository.

## Source control

As mentioned in the [Concepts](./concepts.md) section, we don't deploy source control as part of the MLOps tools.
We support using any kind of GIT implementation. Here are a few examples:

- [Github](https://github.com)
- [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com)
- [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/)

## CI/CD tool

CI/CD tooling is also out of scope for the MLOps tooling. All building blocks have a commandline interface 
or provide other ways to be controlled from the CI/CD tooling. The source control tools described in the previous
section all provide excellent CI/CD capabilities.
